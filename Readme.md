A program which executes
[Luacheck](https://luacheck.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
to find easy-to-fix style errors in lua code
and then changes the related code.

Currently only codes 212, 213 and 621 are supported.

The program rewrites the files and may be error-prone, so always make a backup
of the code files (e.g. via git) before executing the script.
